# js-apps-spa-furniture
 
A basic SPA built with JS using a routing library 'page', templating library 'lit-html', rest API and a simple express server. The app supports basic CRUD operations, login/logout & register of new users and displays a furniture catalogue, which can be modified. Logged-in users are able to read and create new furniture. Logged-in users should also be able to edit or delete only the furniture they have added and have access to all their publications in 'My Publications'.

# Prerequisites

Open a command prompt in the server directory and run `node server.js` command to execute the service and start the server. By default it runs on port 3030.

Load the **app** folder as a project and install all the needed dependencies by running the command `npm install` in the terminal.

Once the installation is completed run the command `npm start`, this will open the app with live-server on your default browser.

*Note that changes to the data are not permanent and will be wiped when the server is restarted.
